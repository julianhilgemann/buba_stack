# Project Brief: End-to-End Data Pipeline for Bundesbank Time Series Analysis

## Overview
This project is designed to build a fully integrated, portfolio‑quality data pipeline that extracts time series data from the German Bundesbank API, processes and transforms it into a data warehouse format using dbt, applies forecasting methods using Python, and finally visualizes both historical and forecasted data in PowerBI. The project will be orchestrated using Apache Airflow and containerized for reproducibility and eventual deployment on Azure—all while employing version control via Git.

## Objectives
- **Data Extraction:** Retrieve various financial time series (e.g., central bank rates, German bond rates) from the Bundesbank API, handling different data formats such as SDMX and CSV.
- **Data Transformation and Modeling:** Leverage dbt to clean and transform raw data into normalized fact and dimension tables, ensuring a robust data warehouse structure.  
- **Forecasting & Analytics:** Develop and implement econometric and machine learning models (using libraries like statsmodels and scikit-learn) to forecast future trends in the time series data.
- **Orchestration:** Use Apache Airflow to schedule and manually trigger the pipeline, ensuring smooth integration between data extraction, transformation, forecasting, and visualization stages.
- **Visualization:** Use PowerBI to create dashboards that display both the historical time series and the forecast outputs, enabling clear business communication of insights.
- **Reproducibility & Deployment:** Containerize the entire stack with Docker and prepare it for deployment on Azure, showcasing skills in modern software deployment practices.
- **Version Control:** Employ Git to track code changes, enhance collaboration, and document project evolution.

## Scope
- **Extraction:** Develop Python scripts to connect to the Bundesbank API, understand and parse data formats (including SDMX), and store raw data locally or in a staging PostgreSQL database.
- **Transformation:** Structure the data warehouse using dbt by creating staging layers, fact tables (e.g., interest rates), dimension tables (e.g., series metadata, frequency), and intermediary models to integrate forecasting outputs.
- **Modeling and Forecasting:** Implement forecasting models that generate outputs and metrics, storing these along with model parameters in the data warehouse for transparency.
- **Orchestration and Workflow:** Create an Airflow DAG that orchestrates these tasks in a sequential, manually triggered pipeline.
- **Visualization:** Connect PostgreSQL to PowerBI and create a dashboard that illustrates both raw and transformed data, as well as forecast insights.
- **Containerization:** Write Dockerfiles and docker-compose configurations to ensure the project runs consistently on any platform and can be deployed to the cloud.
- **Documentation:** Include clear README files and documentation within each project component to guide future development and deployment.

## Technical Architecture & Components
- **Python Environment:**  
  - Core language for scripting data extraction, processing, and forecasting.  
  - Familiarize with Python basics, file I/O, virtual environments, and module organization.
- **APIs & Data Formats:**  
  - Use the `requests` library to make HTTP calls.
  - Parse JSON, CSV, and SDMX (using `pandasdmx`) formats.
- **Databases & Data Modeling:**  
  - PostgreSQL for data storage.
  - Design fact and dimension tables to support a star schema—storing raw financial metrics and associated metadata.
- **Data Transformation with dbt:**  
  - Use dbt to write SQL-based transformation scripts that clean and integrate data.
  - Create staging models, mart models, and seed data files where necessary.
- **Workflow Orchestration with Airflow:**  
  - Define a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to manage the pipeline’s tasks, such as extraction, loading into PostgreSQL, dbt transformations, forecasting, and notifications.
- **Forecasting & Econometrics:**  
  - Apply time series methods (e.g., ARIMA, regression models) using Python libraries like statsmodels and scikit-learn.
- **Visualization with PowerBI:**  
  - Connect directly to your PostgreSQL database.
  - Build dashboards that merge historical data with forecast outputs.
- **Containerization & Deployment:**  
  - Use Docker to containerize all components.
  - Create Docker Compose files to run Airflow, Postgres, and other services together.
  - Prepare the project for deployment on Azure (using Azure Container Instances or AKS).

## Deliverables
- **Code Repository:** A well-organized project structure with clear directories for Airflow, dbt, source scripts, tests, and Docker configurations.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive README files and inline comments, including a setup guide, execution instructions, and architectural overview.
- **Working Pipeline:** A manually triggerable Airflow DAG that orchestrates extraction, transformation, forecasting, and visualization.
- **Data Models:** Normalized fact and dimension table designs with clearly defined data types and relationships.
- **Containerized Environment:** Docker configurations to run the entire stack locally and on Azure.
- **Visualization Dashboard:** A PowerBI dashboard connected to PostgreSQL that visualizes both historical and forecasted data.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a full end‑to‑end BI and data engineering solution, combining core data extraction techniques, ETL processes, forecasting analytics, and interactive visualization. It is an ideal portfolio piece for showcasing your ability to design and manage a modern data pipeline, from data ingestion to business intelligence, while also highlighting skills in Python programming, SQL, and containerized cloud deployments.
