# 📊 End-to-End BI Pipeline Curriculum

Welcome to your structured learning path! This curriculum will help you build an **end-to-end Business Intelligence (BI) pipeline** from scratch. You'll progress from **Python fundamentals** to **data engineering, orchestration, forecasting**, and ultimately **deployment and visualization**.

---

## 🧠 1. Python Programming Fundamentals

**🎯 Objective:** Write modular Python scripts and organize your project effectively.

### 🔹 Key Topics:
- **Syntax & Data Types:** Variables, integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries.
- **Control Structures:** If/else logic, `for` and `while` loops.
- **Functions & Modules:** Reusable functions, Python module system, `import` mechanics.
- **File Management:** Read/write files, manage paths using `os` or `pathlib`.
- **Environments & Packages:** `venv`, `pip`, `requirements.txt`.

> 🛠️ *Why it matters:* Everything from API calls to forecasts will run on Python. Knowing how to structure and organize your scripts is the foundation.

---

## 🌐 2. APIs and Data Formats

**🎯 Objective:** Fetch data from external APIs (like Bundesbank) and understand the formats.

### 🔹 Key Topics:
- **HTTP Basics:** GET & POST requests using `requests`.
- **Data Formats:** Work with JSON, CSV, and SDMX using `json`, `pandas`, and `pandasdmx`.
- **Networking Concepts:** Understand ports and gateways for future deployment.

> 🛠️ *Why it matters:* APIs are your data sources. You’ll automate fetching, parsing, and storing the data.

---

## 🔄 3. Data Extraction & Processing in Python

**🎯 Objective:** Load data from APIs and prepare it using `pandas`.

### 🔹 Key Topics:
- **Data Extraction:** Use `requests` and `pandasdmx` to query APIs.
- **Processing:** Clean, filter, and transform data using `pandas`.

> 🛠️ *Why it matters:* Clean and structured data is essential for accurate forecasting and analysis.

---

## 🗃️ 4. Databases and Data Modeling

**🎯 Objective:** Store and organize data in PostgreSQL with normalized schema design.

### 🔹 Key Topics:
- **SQL Basics:** Learn `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- **Data Modeling:** Design fact and dimension tables using a star schema.
- **Tools:** Use `psycopg2` or `SQLAlchemy` to connect Python to PostgreSQL.

> 🛠️ *Why it matters:* A well-designed schema improves performance, readability, and scalability of your BI system.

---

## 🏗️ 5. Data Transformation with dbt

**🎯 Objective:** Transform raw data into analytical models using dbt.

### 🔹 Key Topics:
- **Project Structure:** Learn about models, seeds, macros.
- **Transformations:** Write modular SQL scripts with logic separated into staging and marts.

> 🛠️ *Why it matters:* dbt ensures your SQL transformations are version-controlled, testable, and production-ready.

---

## ⏱️ 6. Orchestration with Apache Airflow

**🎯 Objective:** Schedule and automate your data workflows.

### 🔹 Key Topics:
- **Airflow Concepts:** DAGs, PythonOperator, BashOperator.
- **Task Management:** Define dependencies and execution schedules.
- **Monitoring:** Log outputs, debug failed tasks.

> 🛠️ *Why it matters:* Orchestration is key to automating data pipelines and ensuring reliability.

---

## 📈 7. Forecasting, Econometrics & Machine Learning

**🎯 Objective:** Apply statistical and ML models for time series forecasting.

### 🔹 Key Topics:
- **Econometrics:** ARIMA models, trend decomposition using `statsmodels`.
- **Machine Learning:** Regression with `scikit-learn`, performance metrics.
- **Integration:** Store and retrieve data for forecasting using PostgreSQL.

> 🛠️ *Why it matters:* Forecasts add predictive power and business value to your BI pipeline.

---

## 📦 8. Containerization & Deployment

**🎯 Objective:** Package your application using Docker and prepare for cloud deployment.

### 🔹 Key Topics:
- **Docker:** Create `Dockerfile`s and use `docker-compose`.
- **Networking:** Expose ports, understand gateways.
- **Cloud Basics:** Prepare for Azure deployments using containers.

> 🛠️ *Why it matters:* Containers make your app portable, consistent, and ready for production environments.

---

## 🔁 9. Version Control with Git & GitHub

**🎯 Objective:** Track code changes and collaborate efficiently.

### 🔹 Key Topics:
- **Git Essentials:** Commits, branches, merges, `.gitignore`.
- **GitHub Integration:** Host and share your code online.

> 🛠️ *Why it matters:* Professional-grade data projects require robust version control.

---

## 📊 10. Data Visualization with PowerBI

**🎯 Objective:** Build reports and dashboards for data-driven decision making.

### 🔹 Key Topics:
- **Connect to PostgreSQL or CSV.**
- **Build Dashboards:** Use slicers, filters, charts, and KPIs.

> 🛠️ *Why it matters:* Visualizations bridge the gap between data and insight.

---

## 🔄 11. End-to-End Integration

**🎯 Objective:** Connect all components into a single, working pipeline.

### 🔹 Key Topics:
- **Pipeline Flow:** API → PostgreSQL → dbt → Forecasts → PowerBI.
- **Airflow DAG:** Trigger all steps manually or on schedule.
- **Testing & Monitoring:** Use logging, unit tests, integration tests.

> 🛠️ *Why it matters:* Full integration proves you’ve built a functioning, modular, and scalable BI system.
